# User-Input-Webscraping-Tool

The Python based project is designed to retrieve product information from popular online shopping websites based on user-input.
Extracted data will be later fed to the Data-Processing-And-Lookup-Tool to analyze and streamline decision making on the user's part.

The program will be responsible for the following processes:
  1. Extract title, price, and link of all products found from the website based on user-input search term.
  2. Output all extracted data of value into a CSV file to be handled by the Data-Processing-And-Lookup-Tool.
  3. Email notification when price is within range of the user's choice.
  4. Config for multiple product/website scraping and how often the program will run.
  5. Seamless communication between User-Input-Webscraping-Tool and Data-Processing-And-Lookup-Tool.
